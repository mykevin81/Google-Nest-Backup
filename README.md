# Google Nest Camera Backup Docker

This is a fork from [TamirMa/google-nest-telegram-sync](https://github.com/TamirMa/google-nest-telegram-sync) It was his research that make this possible

Things for upgrade:
1. Dockerize
2. create a keep file system to auto keep files for certain amount of time
3. add AI? or integration into Frigate? we'll see
